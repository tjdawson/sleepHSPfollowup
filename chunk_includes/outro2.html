    The aim of this study is to better understand how children (and adults) learn the meaning of new words.
In particular, this study asks about the kind of hypotheses learners might entertain when learning words from their environment:
        do they hypothesize a single meaning for any given word (e.g., "telpen" means bag) or do they maintain multiple hypotheses (e.g., "telpen" might mean bag, or truck or maybe
        cat) and track the co-occurrence of a given word with different objects? Some other questions we are trying to answer are: If multiple hypotheses are entertained during
        learning, are they equally likely to be remembered during later testing? Do people who sleep after learning exhibit different recall patterns from people that do not sleep
        between the learning and the follow-up testing session?
</p>

        In the experiment, you were asked to try to glean the meanings of words (disguised as "mystery words") by observing parent-toddler conversational interactions. Across subjects, we
        vary how we ask you to respond to each video immediately after it was shown, to see how these factors affect your ability to correctly infer the word's different meanings.
        There are three conditions: in one, we ask some people to guess only once per video. In another, we ask people to guess up to five times per video. Yet another group of
        people do not write down any guesses, and only rate the perceived informativity of parent-child interactions. Since very young children do not yet have the built-up
        advantage of many tools (e.g. syntactic structure) that adults employ to guess the meaning of "new" words, we also turn off the audio in the video clips you watch to
        simulate their learning environment.
Our hypothesis is that sleep will help improve your learning of novel words, especially in conditions where you we asked to you guess only once after each video. We
        will be analyzing your guesses to determine how well you were able to learn the "new" words that caretakers were saying given these factors.</p>
