    <p>
        When you came into the lab either yesterday evening, or earlier this morning for Part 1 of the experiment, you watched videos of parents interacting with their children.
        During these videos, 12 novel words were spoken. The rest of the audio was silenced, and you were exposed to each of these 12 words 5 times.
        Now we want to ask you about the meanings of those words.
    </p>
    <p>
        You will be listening to audio files of the mystery words you heard in the videos. You will see a blank screen and hear the mystery word twice.
        Then, a question will appear, asking about the meaning of that word &ndash; for example, "Does BLICK mean unicorn?" <br>
        You will respond by clicking 'yes' or 'no'.
        Then, you will rate from 1 to 5 how confident you are in your answer. A rating of 1 means you are not at all sure of your guess, and a rating of 5 means you are very sure.
        This will be the same procedure for every word.
